Hi, my name is Kyul Lee.
- I work as a digital specialist at Morgan Stanley, while studying data analytics in HU.
- Some of my hobbies include illustration, mixing/listening to music, and photography.
- I do not have much experience in coding besides C++ but I will try my best at learning other languages as well!
